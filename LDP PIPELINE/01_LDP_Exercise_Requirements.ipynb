    "# Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline Exercise - Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with building a **Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline** to process e-commerce data from raw JSON files. The data contains various **data quality issues** that you must identify and resolve as you build your pipeline through the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this exercise, you will:\n",
    "- Design and implement a Bronze layer to ingest raw data\n",
    "- Design and implement a Silver layer to clean and transform data\n",
    "- Design and implement a Gold layer to create analytical tables for dashboards\n",
    "- Handle data quality issues including duplicates, missing values, invalid formats, and data type inconsistencies\n",
    "- Create a Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline using SQL or PySpark (Delta Live Tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **REQUIRED**: Run `00_LDP_Exercise_Setup_Environment.ipynb` first to set up the environment and generate sample data\n",
    "2. Familiarity with SQL and data transformation concepts\n",
    "3. Understanding of medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Your raw data is located in Unity Catalog volumes at:\n",
    "```\n",
    "/Volumes/ldp_exercise/exercise_schema/raw/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following data sources are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Products** (`products/00.json`)\n",
    "   - Product catalog information\n",
    "   - Fields: `product_id`, `name`, `category`, `price`, `sku`, `stock_quantity`, `created_at`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customers** (`customers/00.json`)\n",
    "   - Customer master data\n",
    "   - Fields: `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, `phone`, `created_at`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Orders** (`orders/00.json`)\n",
    "   - Order transactions\n",
    "   - Fields: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `status`, `total_amount`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Payments** (`payments/00.json`)\n",
    "   - Payment transactions\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Data Quality Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: The sample data contains intentional data quality issues. You must identify and handle these issues in your pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Duplicates**: Some records appear multiple times\n",
    "- **Missing Values**: NULL values in critical fields\n",
    "- **Invalid Formats**: Incorrect date formats, invalid email addresses, negative prices\n",
    "- **Data Type Issues**: Numbers stored as strings, dates as strings in wrong format\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Data**: Mixed case values, inconsistent state codes\n",
    "- **Orphaned Records**: References to non-existent entities (e.g., orders referencing non-existent customers)\n",
    "- **Invalid Values**: Negative amounts, zero prices, invalid status codes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task**: Identify these issues and implement appropriate data quality checks and transformations in your pipeline.\n",

    "   - Bronze tables: `{entity}_bronze` (e.g., `orders_bronze`, `customers_bronze`)\n",
    "   - Silver tables: `{entity}_silver` (e.g., `orders_silver`, `customers_silver`)\n",
    "   - Gold tables: Use the exact names specified above for dashboard tables\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Catalog and Schema**:\n",
    "   - All tables must be created in: `ldp_exercise.exercise_schema`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Quality**:\n",
    "   - Implement appropriate data quality checks\n",
    "   - Handle or filter invalid records\n",
    "   - Document your data quality decisions in comments\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - Use appropriate table types (STREAMING TABLE for Bronze/Silver, MATERIALIZED VIEW for Gold)\n",
    "   - Consider partitioning if needed\n",
    "   - Use TBLPROPERTIES to mark quality layers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline file(s)** in the `solution/` folder\n",
    "   - Your pipeline should process all four data sources (products, customers, orders, payments)\n",
    "   - Implement Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers\n",
    "   - Create all four required Gold layer dashboard tables\n",
    "   - You can submit either:\n",
    "     - SQL file(s) using Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipeline syntax (`.sql`)\n",
    "     - PySpark file(s) using Delta Live Tables (`.py`)\n",
    "     - Or both if you want to demonstrate proficiency in both approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Documentation** (optional but recommended):\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Correctness**: All four Gold layer tables must match the specified schema and business rules\n",
    "2. **Data Quality**: Proper handling of data quality issues (duplicates, nulls, invalid formats, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Architecture**: Proper implementation of medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)\n",
    "4. **Code Quality**: Clean, readable code (SQL or PySpark) with appropriate comments\n",
    "5. **Completeness**: All data sources processed and integrated appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review the data by exploring the raw JSON files in the volume\n",
    "2. Identify the data quality issues present in each data source\n",
    "3. Design your Bronze layer to ingest raw data\n",
    "4. Design your Silver layer to clean and transform data\n",
    "5. Implement the Gold layer according to the specifications above\n",
    "6. Test your pipeline and verify the Gold layer tables\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by exploring the raw data to understand its structure and issues\n",
    "- Use `STREAM read_files()` for Bronze layer ingestion\n",
    "- Consider using `DISTINCT` or window functions to handle duplicates\n",
    "- Use `TRY_CAST` or `CAST` for data type conversions with error handling\n",
    "- Use `FILTER` or `WHERE` clauses to exclude invalid records\n",
    "- Test incrementally: build Bronze first, then Silver, then Gold\n",
    "- Use the Databricks SQL editor or notebook cells to test your queries before creating the pipeline\n",
