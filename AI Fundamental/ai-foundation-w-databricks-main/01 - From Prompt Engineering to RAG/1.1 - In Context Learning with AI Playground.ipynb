    "In this demo, we will show the importance of providing context when using generative AI models. First, we will prompt the model to provide a response to a query that you know it has no knowledge of, e.g. proprietary information request, personal information request, obscure knowledge request. Then we will review the **response for hallucinations, incorrect information, or lack of detail**. In order to overcome this problem, we will provide the prompt a document or reference that contains the correct information as **supplemental information** and ask the query again. Finally, we will review the new response for a change in detail given the new information as prompt context.\n",

    "Let's augment the prompt with some additional context. In a typical RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application, as discussed in the lecture, this context would be provided by looking up information in a database, typically using vector search based on an embedding model. After giving instructions to prevent generating hallucinated responses, the model can produce responses based on the context provided. Once this information is retrieved, it is then injected into the prompt as additional context. However, you can also experiment directly with this last step by simply providing additional context directly in the prompt in the Playground! This is still Retrieval Augmented Generation, but you are doing the Retrieval part manually. This is great for quickly testing new ideas and experimenting with various LLMs, prompts, and context formats.\n",
