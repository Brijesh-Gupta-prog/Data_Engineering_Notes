    "### The Golden Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One Task = One Partition = One Core**\n",
    "   - A task processes exactly one partition\n",
    "   - A task uses exactly one core\n",
    "   - Multiple tasks can run in parallel on multiple cores\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallelism = Number of Cores**\n",
    "   - Maximum parallelism = Total cores in cluster\n",
    "   - To utilize all cores, you need at least that many partitions/tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimal Partition Count**\n",
    "   - Too few partitions → Underutilization (cores sit idle)\n",
    "   - Too many partitions → Overhead (scheduling overhead dominates)\n",
    "   - Sweet spot: 2-4× the number of cores\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total Cores = Number of Executors × Cores per Executor\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal Partitions = 2-4 × Total Cores\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- 4 executors × 4 cores = 16 cores\n",
    "- Optimal partitions: 32-64 partitions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Means for You\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a data engineer, you should:**\n",
    "- ✅ Understand your cluster configuration (executors, cores)\n",
    "- ✅ Monitor task distribution in Spark UI\n",
    "- ✅ Ensure partitions ≥ cores (ideally 2-4×)\n",
    "- ✅ Avoid creating too few or too many partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n",
    "- ❌ Assuming Spark will automatically use all cores\n",
    "- ❌ Not checking partition count before processing\n",
    "- ❌ Creating millions of tiny partitions\n",
    "- ❌ Having fewer partitions than cores\n"

    "### Key Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Executors** run on worker nodes (JVM processes)\n",
    "2. **Cores** are CPU cores within each executor\n",
    "3. **Tasks** are work units that process partitions\n",
    "4. **Partitions** are logical divisions of data\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Flow:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Data → Partitions → Tasks → Scheduled to Executors → Executed on Cores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- Understand your cluster configuration\n",
    "- Ensure partitions ≥ cores (ideally 2-4×)\n",
    "- Monitor Spark UI for task distribution\n",
    "- Repartition data when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Assume Spark automatically uses all cores\n",
    "- Create too few partitions (underutilization)\n",
    "- Create too many partitions (overhead)\n",
    "- Ignore partition counts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the basics:\n",
    "1. Practice checking partition counts in your DataFrames\n",
    "2. Learn about `repartition()` and `coalesce()` operations\n",
    "3. Explore Spark UI to see tasks in action\n",
    "4. Move on to advanced topics like partition optimization\n",
