    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keys and constraints are the rules that make databases reliable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without them, your database is just a collection of tables with no guarantees. With them, you can ensure:\n",
    "- ✅ No duplicate records\n",
    "- ✅ Relationships between tables are valid\n",
    "- ✅ Data follows business rules\n",
    "- ✅ Critical fields are never empty\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the foundation of data integrity.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snowflake-Specific Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "All SQL examples in this notebook are written for **Snowflake**. Key Snowflake differences:\n",
    "- Uses `IDENTITY(1, 1)` instead of `AUTO_INCREMENT` for auto-incrementing columns\n",
    "- Uses `CURRENT_DATE()` and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` function syntax\n",
    "- Uses `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` (no timezone) or `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` (local timezone) for timestamp types\n",

    "## 1. Primary Key: The Unique Identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Primary Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Primary Key** is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** A social security number, a passport ID, or a student ID. There can only be one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UNIQUE:** No two rows can have the same primary key value\n",
    "2. **NOT NULL:** A primary key cannot be empty\n",
    "3. **IMMUTABLE:** Should never change (best practice)\n",
    "4. **ONE PER TABLE:** Each table can have only one primary key\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Creating a Table with Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Single column primary key\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composite Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a single column isn't enough. You might need multiple columns together to form a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Composite primary key (multiple columns)\n",
    "CREATE TABLE order_items (\n",
    "    order_id INT,\n",
    "    product_id INT,\n",
    "    quantity INT,\n",
    "    price DECIMAL(10, 2),\n",
    "    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)  -- Both together must be unique\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why composite?**\n",
    "- In an order_items table, the same product can appear in multiple orders\n",
    "- The same order can have multiple products\n",
    "- But the combination (order_id + product_id) must be unique\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key vs. Just Unique\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Why not just use UNIQUE instead of PRIMARY KEY?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- Primary keys are automatically indexed (faster lookups)\n",
    "- Primary keys are used by foreign keys to establish relationships\n",
    "- Primary keys are the \"official\" identifier of a row\n",
    "- Only one primary key per table, but multiple UNIQUE constraints allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Foreign Key: Linking Tables Together\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Foreign Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Foreign Key** is a column (or set of columns) in one table that references the primary key of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** A pointer that says \"this row belongs to that row in another table.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Foreign Keys Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without foreign keys:**\n",
    "- You can create an order for a customer that doesn't exist\n",
    "- You can delete a customer, leaving orphaned orders\n",
    "- No enforced relationship between tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**With foreign keys:**\n",
    "- ✅ Database enforces that relationships are valid\n",
    "- ✅ Prevents orphaned records\n",
    "- ✅ Maintains referential integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Creating Foreign Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Parent table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Child table with foreign key\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    customer_id INT,  -- This will reference customers.customer_id\n",
    "    order_date DATE,\n",
    "    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Foreign Keys Prevent\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Invalid References\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- This will FAIL because customer_id 999 doesn't exist\n",
    "INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 999, '2024-01-15', 100.00);\n",
    "-- Error: Foreign key constraint violation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Orphaned Records\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- This will FAIL if there are orders referencing this customer\n",
    "DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 123;\n",
    "-- Error: Cannot delete customer because orders reference it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key Actions: ON DELETE and ON UPDATE\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control what happens when the referenced row is deleted or updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ON DELETE CASCADE\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    customer_id INT,\n",
    "    order_date DATE,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) \n",
    "        REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    "        ON DELETE CASCADE  -- If customer is deleted, delete their orders too\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ON DELETE SET NULL\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    customer_id INT,  -- Must allow NULL\n",
    "    order_date DATE,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) \n",
    "        REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    "        ON DELETE SET NULL  -- If customer is deleted, set customer_id to NULL\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ON DELETE RESTRICT (Default)\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    customer_id INT,\n",
    "    order_date DATE,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) \n",
    "        REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    "        ON DELETE RESTRICT  -- Prevent deletion if orders exist (default behavior)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Options:**\n",
    "- `CASCADE`: Delete/update child rows when parent is deleted/updated\n",
    "- `SET NULL`: Set foreign key to NULL when parent is deleted (column must allow NULL)\n",
    "- `RESTRICT` / `NO ACTION`: Prevent deletion/update if child rows exist\n",
    "- `SET DEFAULT`: Set foreign key to default value when parent is deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Snowflake supports foreign key constraints, but they are not enforced by default in all contexts. Make sure to enable constraint enforcement in your Snowflake session if needed.\n",

    "## 3. NOT NULL: Mandatory Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NOT NULL?\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOT NULL** ensures that a column must always have a value. It cannot be empty or NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** A required field in a form. You can't submit without filling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Must have a value\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,    -- Must have a value\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100),                -- Can be NULL (optional)\n",
    "    phone VARCHAR(20)                  -- Can be NULL (optional)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What NOT NULL Prevents\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- This will FAIL\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, email)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'john@example.com');\n",
    "-- Error: first_name and last_name cannot be NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "-- This will SUCCEED\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john@example.com');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use NOT NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use NOT NULL for:**\n",
    "- ✅ Primary keys (automatic)\n",
    "- ✅ Critical business fields (name, email, price)\n",
    "- ✅ Fields that must always have a value for data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't use NOT NULL for:**\n",
    "- ❌ Optional fields (middle name, phone number)\n",
    "- ❌ Fields that might not be known at creation time\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. UNIQUE: No Duplicates Allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is UNIQUE?\n",
    "\n",
    "**UNIQUE** ensures that all values in a column (or set of columns) are different. No duplicates allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** A username in a system. Each user must have a unique username.\n",

    "| Feature | PRIMARY KEY | UNIQUE |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|--------|\n",
    "| Uniqueness | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n",
    "| NULL values | ❌ Not allowed | ✅ Allowed (usually one NULL) |\n",
    "| Number per table | 1 | Multiple |\n",
    "| Auto-indexed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n",
    "| Used by foreign keys | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Single Column UNIQUE\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,  -- Each username must be unique\n",

    "### Example: Composite UNIQUE\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE enrollments (\n",
    "    student_id INT,\n",
    "    course_id INT,\n",

    "## 5. CHECK: Custom Business Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is CHECK?\n",
    "\n",
    "**CHECK** constraint allows you to define custom rules that data must follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** Validation rules. \"Age must be between 0 and 150\" or \"Price must be positive.\"\n",

    "### Example: Range Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE products (\n",
    "    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (price > 0),  -- Price must be positive\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is DEFAULT?\n",
    "\n",
    "**DEFAULT** provides a value for a column when no value is specified during INSERT.\n",

    "## 8. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use integers (INT, BIGINT)** - Faster than strings\n",
    "2. **Consider auto-increment** - Let the database generate IDs\n",
    "3. **Never change primary keys** - They're meant to be permanent\n",
    "4. **Keep them simple** - Prefer single column over composite when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Good: Auto-incrementing integer (Snowflake uses IDENTITY)\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1, 1),  -- Start at 1, increment by 1\n",
    "    username VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose appropriate ON DELETE action:**\n",
    "   - `CASCADE` for dependent data (order items when order is deleted)\n",
    "   - `RESTRICT` for critical relationships (orders when customer is deleted)\n",
    "   - `SET NULL` for optional relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Index foreign keys** - Most databases do this automatically, but verify\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Name your constraints** - Makes error messages clearer\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Named constraint\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    customer_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) \n",
    "        REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    "        ON DELETE RESTRICT\n",
    "        CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customer  -- Named constraint\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraint Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use NOT NULL liberally** - If a field is always required, make it NOT NULL\n",
    "2. **Use CHECK for business rules** - Enforce rules at the database level, not just in application code\n",
    "3. **Use DEFAULT for common values** - Reduces errors and simplifies inserts\n",
    "4. **Document your constraints** - Explain why they exist\n",
