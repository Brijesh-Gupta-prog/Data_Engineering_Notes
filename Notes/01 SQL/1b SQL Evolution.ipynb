    "# SQL Evolution: From File Systems to Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Real Problem: Data Before Databases (File Systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How data was stored (1960s–70s)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data lived in flat files (text, CSV-like, binary)\n",
    "- Each application owned its own files\n",
    "- Code and data were tightly coupled\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- Payroll app → `payroll.dat`\n",
    "- HR app → `employees.dat`\n",
    "- Finance app → `salaries.dat`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Same employee. Three files. Three truths.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why File Systems Failed (Be Brutal Here)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is why RDBMS had to exist.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Redundancy\n",
    "- Same data copied in multiple files\n",
    "- Storage waste + inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Inconsistency\n",
    "- Update salary in payroll, forget finance\n",
    "- No single source of truth\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Relationships\n",
    "- \"Employee\" and \"Department\" had no enforced link\n",
    "- Everything handled manually in code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Data Integrity\n",
    "- Negative salary? Duplicate IDs? No problem.\n",
    "- Files didn't care.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard Queries\n",
    "- Want \"avg salary by department\"?\n",
    "- Write hundreds of lines of procedural code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Every new question required new code. Data was passive. Logic was everywhere.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The First Shift: Databases Appear (Still Not SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Early databases tried to fix this—but did it poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical Model (IBM IMS)\n",
    "- Tree-like structure\n",
    "- Parent → child only\n",
    "- Rigid and inflexible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Model\n",
    "- Slightly better\n",
    "- Complex pointer-based navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "- Developers had to navigate data step-by-step\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 4. The Breakthrough Idea: Relational Model (1970)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the turning point.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edgar F. Codd (IBM, 1970)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed:**\n",
    "- Data as tables (relations)\n",
    "- Rows = records\n",
    "- Columns = attributes\n",
    "- Relationships via keys\n",
    "\n",
    "**Radical ideas at the time:**\n",
    "- Separate data from application logic\n",
    "- Use mathematics (set theory) to query data\n",
    "- Users describe what they want, not how to get it\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Why SQL Was Created\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL wasn't magic. It was a tool to talk to relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What SQL Means\n",
    "- **Structured Query Language**\n",
    "- Declarative language\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declarative vs Procedural\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Procedural:** How to loop, how to fetch\n",
    "- **Declarative:** What result you want\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, AVG(salary)\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**You never explain:**\n",
    "- Which index to use\n",
    "- How to scan rows\n",
    "- How to aggregate\n",
    "\n",
    "**The database figures it out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drive this home:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"SQL shifted complexity from developers to the database engine.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. RDBMS: What Changed Fundamentally\n",
    "\n",
    "### RDBMS Brought:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Schema\n",
    "- Defined structure\n",
    "- Predictable data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "- **Primary Key**\n",
    "- **Foreign Key**\n",
    "- **NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ACID Transactions\n",
    "- **Atomicity**\n",
    "- **Consistency**\n",
    "- **Isolation**\n",
    "- **Durability**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query Optimization\n",
    "- Same SQL\n",
    "- Faster execution as engines improved\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-user Access\n",
    "- Concurrent reads/writes\n",
    "- Locking & isolation\n"

    "## 7. Understanding ACID Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**ACID** is what makes databases reliable. Think of it as a guarantee that your data operations are safe and predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Real-World Analogy: Bank Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine transferring $100 from your account to a friend's account. This involves two steps:\n",
    "1. Deduct $100 from your account\n",
    "2. Add $100 to your friend's account\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without ACID:** What if step 1 succeeds but step 2 fails? Your money disappears! 💸\n",
    "\n",
    "**With ACID:** Either both steps succeed, or both fail. No money disappears. ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### A - Atomicity: \"All or Nothing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple definition:** A transaction is like a single, indivisible unit. Either everything happens, or nothing happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** A light switch. It's either ON or OFF. There's no \"halfway on.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;  -- Your account\n",
    "  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;  -- Friend's account\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "- ✅ If both updates succeed → Transaction commits. Money transferred.\n",
    "- ❌ If either update fails → Transaction rolls back. Both accounts unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:** You'll never see a state where money is deducted but not added, or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### C - Consistency: \"Rules Always Apply\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple definition:** The database always follows its rules. Invalid states are impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** A vending machine. It won't give you a product if you don't pay enough. The rules are enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Rule: Account balance cannot be negative\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1 AND balance >= 500;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "- ✅ If balance is $600 → Transaction succeeds. New balance: $100.\n",
    "- ❌ If balance is $300 → Transaction fails. Balance stays $300. Rule enforced!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:** Constraints (like \"balance >= 0\") are always maintained, even during transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### I - Isolation: \"Your Transaction Doesn't See Others' Mess\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple definition:** Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other. Each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** Multiple people editing different parts of a document. They don't see each other's unsaved changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "- **Transaction A:** Reading account balance (sees $1000)\n",
    "- **Transaction B:** At the same time, updating balance to $1500\n",
    "- **Transaction A:** Still sees $1000 until Transaction B commits\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "- Without isolation: Transaction A might see partial updates (inconsistent data)\n",
    "- With isolation: Transaction A sees a consistent snapshot, as if Transaction B didn't exist yet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:** Each transaction operates as if it's the only one running, even when many are running simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### D - Durability: \"Once Saved, It's Permanent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple definition:** Once a transaction commits, the changes are permanent, even if the system crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** Writing in permanent ink. Even if you spill coffee on the paper, the writing remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "  INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, amount) VALUES (123, 500);\n",
    "COMMIT;  -- Transaction is now durable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "- ✅ After COMMIT → Data is written to disk\n",
    "- 💥 System crashes 1 second later → Data is still there when system restarts\n",
    "- ✅ Your order is not lost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:** Committed data survives power failures, crashes, and restarts. It's written to persistent storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why ACID Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without ACID:**\n",
    "- Money could disappear during transfers\n",
    "- Data could become inconsistent\n",
    "- Concurrent users could see corrupted data\n",
    "- System crashes could lose your work\n",
    "\n",
    "**With ACID:**\n",
    "- ✅ Financial transactions are safe\n",
    "- ✅ Data integrity is guaranteed\n",
    "- ✅ Multiple users can work simultaneously\n",
    "- ✅ Your data survives crashes\n"
