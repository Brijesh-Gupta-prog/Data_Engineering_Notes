    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into advanced concepts like primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, it's essential to understand the fundamental SQL statements that allow you to interact with databases. This notebook covers the core SQL operations you'll use every day as a data engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- SQL syntax basics\n",
    "- DDL (Data Definition Language) statements\n",
    "- DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements\n",
    "- INSERT operations\n",
    "- DELETE operations\n",

    "## 1. Understanding SQL Statement Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic SQL Syntax Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL statements follow a consistent structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keywords are case-insensitive** (but conventionally written in UPPERCASE)\n",
    "2. **Statements end with a semicolon** (`;`) in most databases\n",
    "3. **Whitespace is generally ignored** (use it for readability)\n",
    "4. **Strings are enclosed in single quotes** (`'text'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Structure:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "KEYWORD column1, column2\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Not all statements follow this exact pattern, but most do.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. SQL Statement Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL statements are organized into categories based on their purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "### DDL - Data Definition Language\n",
    "**Purpose:** Define and modify database structure\n",
    "- `CREATE` - Create tables, databases, indexes\n",
    "- `ALTER` - Modify existing structures\n",
    "- `DROP` - Delete structures\n",
    "- `TRUNCATE` - Remove all data from a table\n",
    "\n",
    "### DML - Data Manipulation Language\n",
    "**Purpose:** Manipulate data within tables\n",
    "- `SELECT` - Query/retrieve data\n",
    "- `INSERT` - Add new rows\n",
    "- `UPDATE` - Modify existing rows\n",
    "- `DELETE` - Remove specific rows\n",
    "\n",
    "### DCL - Data Control Language\n",
    "**Purpose:** Control access and permissions\n",
    "- `GRANT` - Give permissions\n",
    "- `REVOKE` - Remove permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "### TCL - Transaction Control Language\n",
    "**Purpose:** Manage transactions\n",
    "- `COMMIT` - Save changes\n",
    "- `ROLLBACK` - Undo changes\n",
    "- `SAVEPOINT` - Create transaction checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus of this notebook:** DDL and DML (the most commonly used)\n"

    "## 3. DDL Statements: Creating and Modifying Database Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 CREATE Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CREATE` statement is used to create new database objects like tables, databases, or indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Syntax:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "    column1 datatype constraints,\n",
    "    column2 datatype constraints,\n",
    "    column3 datatype constraints\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    hire_date DATE,\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Each column has a name and data type\n",
    "- Common data types: `INT`, `VARCHAR(n)`, `DATE`, `DECIMAL(p, s)`, `BOOLEAN`\n",
    "- Constraints can be added (we'll cover these in detail later)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Database\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE company_db;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating an Index\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_email ON employees(email);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 ALTER Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ALTER` statement modifies existing database structures without dropping and recreating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding a Column\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying a Column\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ALTER COLUMN salary DECIMAL(12, 2);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropping a Column\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "DROP COLUMN department;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Constraints\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT pk_employee PRIMARY KEY (employee_id);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 DROP Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DROP` statement permanently deletes database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** This is irreversible! Be very careful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropping a Table\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropping a Database\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP DATABASE company_db;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropping an Index\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP INDEX idx_email;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:**\n",
    "- `DROP TABLE` removes the table structure AND all data\n",
    "- `DELETE` removes only data (we'll see this in DML section)\n"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SELECT with ORDER BY\n",

    "SELECT first_name, last_name, salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "ORDER BY salary DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SELECT with Aggregate Functions\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    department,\n",
    "    COUNT(*) as employee_count,\n",
    "    AVG(salary) as avg_salary\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@company.com', '2024-01-15', 75000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Clear which values go to which columns\n",
    "- Order doesn't matter\n",
    "- Can omit columns with default values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: Insert Without Column Names\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees\n",
    "VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@company.com', '2024-02-20', 80000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Must provide values for ALL columns in the exact table order\n",
    "- Less flexible, more error-prone\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 3: Insert Multiple Rows\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary)\n",
    "VALUES \n",
    "    (3, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'bob.johnson@company.com', '2024-03-10', 70000),\n",

    "#### Method 4: Insert from Another Table\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary)\n",
    "SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary\n",
    "FROM temp_employees\n",
    "WHERE hire_date > '2024-01-01';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET salary = 80000\n",
    "WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical:** Always use `WHERE` clause! Without it, ALL rows are updated.\n",

    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET \n",
    "    salary = 85000,\n",
    "    email = 'john.doe.new@company.com'\n",
    "WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UPDATE with Calculations\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET salary = salary * 1.10  -- 10% raise\n",
    "WHERE department = 'Engineering';\n",

    "## 5. TRUNCATE vs DELETE: Critical Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `TRUNCATE` and `DELETE` remove data from a table, but they work very differently.\n",

    "### TRUNCATE Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How TRUNCATE Works:**\n",
    "1. Removes ALL rows instantly\n",
    "2. Cannot use WHERE clause (always removes all data)\n",
    "3. Cannot be rolled back (in most databases)\n",
    "4. Resets auto-increment counters\n",
    "5. Faster than DELETE for large tables\n",
    "6. Doesn't fire triggers (in most databases)\n",
    "7. Maintains table structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "-- All employee data is gone, but table structure remains\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees;  -- Removes all rows\n",
    "-- OR\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees WHERE condition;  -- Removes specific rows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How DELETE Works:**\n",
    "1. Removes rows one by one\n",
    "2. Can use WHERE clause (selective deletion)\n",
    "3. Can be rolled back (if in a transaction)\n",
    "4. Doesn't reset auto-increment counters\n",

    "✅ **Use DELETE when:**\n",
    "- You need to remove specific rows (with WHERE clause)\n",
    "- You need the operation to be rollback-able\n",
    "- You have triggers that must fire\n",
    "- You need detailed logging of what was deleted\n",
    "- You're working with a small number of rows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE hire_date < '2020-01-01';\n",
    "-- Removes only old employees\n",

    "### When to Use TRUNCATE\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use TRUNCATE when:**\n",
    "- You want to remove ALL rows from a table\n",
    "- You need maximum performance (large tables)\n",
    "- You don't need rollback capability\n",
    "- You want to reset auto-increment counters\n",
    "- You're clearing staging/temporary tables\n",

    "\n",
    "### Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "**DELETE** is like removing specific items from a shopping cart one by one.\n",
    "- You can be selective\n",
    "- You can undo it\n",
    "- Takes time if you have many items\n",
    "\n",
    "**TRUNCATE** is like emptying the entire shopping cart at once.\n",
    "- Everything goes\n",
    "- Can't undo\n",
    "- Instant operation\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a Table\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE products (\n",
    "    product_id INT,\n",
    "    product_name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    category VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    price DECIMAL(10, 2),\n",
    "    stock_quantity INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Insert Data\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, category, price, stock_quantity)\n",
    "VALUES \n",
    "    (1, 'Laptop', 'Electronics', 999.99, 50),\n",

    "    (4, 'Monitor', 'Electronics', 299.99, 75);\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Step 3: Query Data\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics';\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Step 4: Update Data\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE products\n",
    "SET price = 949.99\n",
    "WHERE product_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 8. Best Practices and Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always use WHERE with UPDATE and DELETE**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- ✅ Good\n",
    "   DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 5;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -- ❌ Dangerous\n",
    "   DELETE FROM employees;  -- Deletes everything!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use transactions for critical operations**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;\n",
    "   COMMIT;  -- Or ROLLBACK if something goes wrong\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Specify column names in INSERT**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- ✅ Good (clear and flexible)\n",
    "   INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email) \n",
    "   VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john@company.com');\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -- ⚠️ Less clear\n",
    "   INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john@company.com', ...);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test with SELECT before UPDATE/DELETE**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- First, see what will be affected\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary < 30000;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -- Then, perform the operation\n",
    "   DELETE FROM employees WHERE salary < 30000;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use meaningful table and column names**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- ✅ Good\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE customer_orders (...);\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -- ❌ Bad\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE tbl1 (...);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forgetting WHERE clause in UPDATE/DELETE**\n",
    "   - Results in updating/deleting ALL rows\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using single quotes for numbers**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- ❌ Wrong\n",
    "   WHERE salary = '50000';  -- Treats as string\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -- ✅ Correct\n",
    "   WHERE salary = 50000;  -- Treats as number\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Case sensitivity in string comparisons**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- May behave differently in different databases\n",
    "   WHERE department = 'Engineering';  -- vs 'engineering'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Not handling NULL values correctly**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- ❌ Wrong (NULL comparisons don't work this way)\n",
    "   WHERE department = NULL;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -- ✅ Correct\n",
    "   WHERE department IS NULL;\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "## 9. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DDL** (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE) manages database structure\n",
    "2. **DML** (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) manages data\n",
    "3. **DELETE** removes specific rows and can be rolled back\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE** removes all rows quickly but cannot be rolled back\n",
    "5. **Always use WHERE clause** with UPDATE and DELETE\n",
    "6. **Test with SELECT** before modifying data\n",
    "7. **Use transactions** for critical operations\n",
