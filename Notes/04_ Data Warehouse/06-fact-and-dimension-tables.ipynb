        "\n",
        "### Fact Table Rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Grain Definition**\n",
        "   - Clearly define the grain (level of detail)\n",
        "   - One row = one measurement event\n",
        "   - Document grain explicitly\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Additivity**\n",
        "   - Facts should be additive\n",
        "   - Can be summed across dimensions\n",
        "   - Handle semi-additive and non-additive facts appropriately\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Foreign Keys**\n",
        "   - All foreign keys must have corresponding dimension rows\n",
        "   - Use surrogate keys, not natural keys\n",
        "   - Maintain referential integrity\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Degenerate Dimensions**\n",
        "   - Transaction numbers, invoice numbers\n",
        "   - Stored in fact table (not a separate dimension)\n",
        "   - Used for drill-down to transaction detail\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Null Handling**\n",
        "   - Avoid null foreign keys (use \"Unknown\" dimension rows)\n",
        "   - Null facts may be acceptable (use 0 or NULL based on business rules)\n",
        "   - Document null handling strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Fact Types**\n",
        "   - **Measures**: Numeric facts (amounts, quantities)\n",
        "   - **Text Facts**: Rare, usually in dimensions\n",
        "   - **Counts**: Can be facts or derived\n",
        "\n",
        "### Transaction Fact Table Specific Rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Time Stamps**: Include transaction timestamp\n",
        "- **Event-Based**: One event = one row\n",
        "- **No Aggregation**: Store at transaction level\n",
        "- **Historical**: Preserve all historical transactions\n",
        "\n",
        "## Primary and Foreign Keys for Fact Tables\n",
        "\n",
        "### Primary Keys:\n",

        "- Made up of multiple columns\n",
        "- Include all dimension foreign keys\n",
        "- Include degenerate dimensions\n",
        "- Ensure uniqueness\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",

        ");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Foreign Keys:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Characteristics:**\n",
        "- Link to dimension tables\n",
        "- Use surrogate keys (integers)\n",
        "- All foreign keys should have corresponding dimension rows\n",
        "- Index all foreign keys for performance\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE sales_transaction_fact (\n",
        "    transaction_date_key INT REFERENCES date_dimension(date_key),\n",

        "\n",
        "### Key Best Practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Surrogate Keys**: Always use surrogate keys in fact tables\n",
        "- **Indexing**: Index all foreign key columns\n",
        "- **Referential Integrity**: Enforce or validate referential integrity\n",
        "- **Unknown Keys**: Use -1 or 0 for unknown/not applicable\n",
        "- **Composite Keys**: Use when single key doesn't ensure uniqueness\n",
