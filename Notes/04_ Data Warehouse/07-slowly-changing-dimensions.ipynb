        "## Introduction to Slowly Changing Dimensions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)** are dimension tables where attribute values change slowly over time. Different SCD types handle these changes in different ways, balancing between historical accuracy and current state.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) and Data Warehouse History\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why SCDs Matter:\n",
        "\n",
        "In operational systems, when a customer's address changes, the old address is typically overwritten. In data warehouses, we often need to:\n",
        "- Preserve historical accuracy\n",
        "- Track changes over time\n",
        "- Support time-based analysis\n",
        "- Maintain referential integrity with historical facts\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Challenge:\n",
        "\n",
        "When a dimension attribute changes:\n",
        "- Should we overwrite the old value? (Lose history)\n",
        "- Should we create a new row? (Preserve history, but how to link facts?)\n",
        "- Should we add a column? (Track limited history)\n",
        "\n",
        "### SCD Types:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Type 1**: Overwrite (no history)\n",
        "2. **Type 2**: Add new row (full history)\n",
        "3. **Type 3**: Add new column (limited history)\n",
        "4. **Type 4**: Historical table (separate history)\n",
        "5. **Type 6**: Hybrid (combines 1, 2, 3)\n",

        "## Design a Type 1 SCD\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **No Overlapping Dates**\n",
        "   - Each version must have non-overlapping date ranges\n",
        "   - One version must expire before next begins\n",
        "   - Gap of one day between versions is acceptable\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **One Current Row**\n",
        "   - Only one row per natural key should have `is_current = TRUE`\n",
        "   - Only one row should have `expiry_date = '9999-12-31'`\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sequential Surrogate Keys**\n",
        "   - New versions get new surrogate keys\n",
        "   - Natural key remains the same\n",
        "   - Surrogate keys should be sequential for same natural key\n",

        "\n",
        "You can combine SCD types for different attributes:\n",
        "- Some attributes Type 1 (overwrite)\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Type 1**: Overwrite, no history, simplest\n",
        "2. **Type 2**: New row, full history, most common\n",
        "3. **Type 3**: Previous column, limited history\n",
        "4. **Choose based on**: Business requirements, change frequency, history needs\n",
        "5. **Type 2 requires**: Careful date management, validation, proper ETL\n",

        "### Best Practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Document SCD type for each attribute\n",
        "- Validate date ranges for Type 2\n",
        "- Index appropriately (natural key, effective_date, is_current)\n",
        "- Handle NULLs and unknown values\n",
        "- Test ETL processes thoroughly\n"
