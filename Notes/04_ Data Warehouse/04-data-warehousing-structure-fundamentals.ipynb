        "### Key Principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Business Process Focus**\n",
        "   - Model around business processes (sales, orders, shipments)\n",
        "   - Not around departments or applications\n",
        "   - Each process becomes a fact table\n",

        "\n",
        "5. **Additivity**\n",
        "   - Facts should be additive across dimensions\n",
        "   - Some facts are semi-additive (balances)\n",
        "   - Some are non-additive (ratios, percentages)\n",
