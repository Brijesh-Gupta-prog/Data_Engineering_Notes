    "## 1. What is a View?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **view** is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SQL query. Unlike a physical table, a view does not store data itself. Instead, it stores the query definition and executes it every time the view is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Virtual**: No physical storage of data\n",
    "- **Dynamic**: Always reflects current data from underlying tables\n",
    "- **Query-based**: Defined by a SELECT statement\n",
    "- **Read-only or Updatable**: Depending on the query complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Views?\n",
    "1. **Simplify complex queries**: Hide complexity from end users\n",
    "2. **Security**: Restrict access to specific columns/rows\n",
    "3. **Consistency**: Provide standardized data access\n",
    "4. **Abstraction**: Change underlying structure without affecting users\n"

    "3. **Views simplify complexity** - Hide complex joins and logic from end users\n",
    "4. **Views provide security** - Control access to sensitive data\n",
    "5. **Views execute on-demand** - Query is merged and optimized at runtime\n",
    "6. **Materialized views store data** - Better performance but need refresh\n",
    "7. **Choose wisely** - Use regular views for real-time data, materialized views for analytics\n"

    "### View Management in Snowflake\n",

    "- **View Metadata**: Use `SHOW VIEWS` to list all views\n",
    "- **View Definition**: Use `SHOW VIEWS LIKE 'view_name'` or query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS`\n",
    "- **Drop View**: `DROP VIEW view_name`\n",
    "- **Alter View**: `ALTER VIEW view_name RENAME TO new_name`\n",

    "1. **Naming Convention**: Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., `customer_order_summary_view`)\n",
