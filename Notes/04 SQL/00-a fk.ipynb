    "## 6. Best Practices and Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table\n",
    "2. **Foreign Key**: Creates a relationship between tables, referencing a primary key\n",
    "3. **Referential Integrity**: Ensures data consistency between related tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deletion Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **CORRECT**: Delete child records first, then parent records\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 1;      -- Delete child first\n",
    "DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;   -- Then delete parent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **INCORRECT**: Trying to delete parent when children exist\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;   -- This will fail if orders exist\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always check for child records** before deleting parent records\n",
    "2. **Use transactions** to ensure atomicity (all or nothing)\n",
    "3. **Consider soft deletes** (marking records as deleted) instead of hard deletes\n",
    "4. **Document relationships** clearly in your database schema\n",
    "5. **Use CASCADE DELETE carefully** - it can cause unintended data loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Query to Check Before Deletion:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Before deleting a customer, check if they have orders\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    c.customer_id,\n",
    "    c.customer_name,\n",
    "    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count\n",
    "FROM customers c\n",
    "LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n",
    "WHERE c.customer_id = ?  -- Replace ? with the customer_id you want to delete\n",
    "GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name;\n",

    "\n",
    "- Snowflake supports **declarative referential integrity** (foreign key constraints)\n",
    "- However, foreign key constraints are **informational** by default and not enforced at runtime\n",
    "- This means Snowflake will validate the constraint definition but won't prevent invalid data insertion\n",
    "- To enforce constraints, you may need to:\n",
    "  - Use application-level validation\n",
    "  - Implement stored procedures with validation logic\n",
    "  - Use triggers (if supported in your Snowflake edition)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Still Matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Snowflake doesn't enforce foreign keys by default, understanding these concepts is crucial because:\n",
    "1. **Data Quality**: Maintaining referential integrity ensures data consistency\n",
    "2. **Query Performance**: Proper relationships help with query optimization\n",
    "3. **Business Logic**: Many business rules depend on maintaining these relationships\n",
    "4. **Other Databases**: Most production databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) enforce these constraints strictly\n",
