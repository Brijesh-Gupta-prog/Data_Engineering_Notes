    "## 1. Introduction to CTAS (Create Table As Select)\n",
    "\n",
    "**CTAS** (Create Table As Select) is a SQL statement that creates a new table and populates it with data from a SELECT query in a single operation. It's one of the most efficient ways to create and populate a table in a data warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Single Operation**: Creates table and inserts data in one statement\n",
    "- **Atomic**: Either succeeds completely or fails completely\n",
    "- **Efficient**: Optimized for bulk data loading\n",
    "- **Schema Inference**: Automatically infers column types from SELECT query\n",
    "- **No Separate INSERT**: Data is loaded during table creation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use CTAS?\n",
    "1. **Performance**: Faster than CREATE + INSERT for large datasets\n",
    "2. **Simplicity**: One statement instead of multiple\n",
    "3. **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing operation\n",
    "4. **Schema Flexibility**: Automatically creates schema from query results\n"

    "## 2. CTAS Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for CTAS in Snowflake is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE [OR REPLACE] TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name\n",
    "[(\n",
    "    column_name column_type [DEFAULT default_value] [NOT NULL],\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ")]\n",
    "AS\n",
    "SELECT ...\n",
    "[ORDER BY ...]\n",
    "[CLUSTER BY ...];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Components:\n",
    "- **CREATE TABLE**: Standard table creation clause\n",
    "- **OR REPLACE**: Optionally replace existing table\n",
    "- **IF NOT EXISTS**: Only create if table doesn't exist\n",
    "- **AS SELECT**: The query that populates the table\n",
    "- **ORDER BY**: Optional ordering (affects storage clustering in Snowflake)\n",
    "- **CLUSTER BY**: Optional clustering key for optimization\n"

    "## 8. Introduction to Temporary Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporary tables** are tables that exist only for the duration of a session or transaction. They are useful for storing intermediate results during complex data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Session-scoped**: Exists only for the current session\n",
    "- **Automatic Cleanup**: Automatically dropped when session ends\n",
    "- **No Persistence**: Data is not persisted across sessions\n",
    "- **Performance**: Often stored in memory or temp space (faster)\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Each session has its own temporary tables\n",
    "- **No Sharing**: Cannot be accessed by other sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Temporary Tables?\n",
    "1. **Intermediate Results**: Store results of complex calculations\n",
    "2. **Performance**: Faster than permanent tables for temporary data\n",
    "3. **Isolation**: Each session's data is isolated\n",
    "4. **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup reduces maintenance\n",
    "5. **Testing**: Safe for testing without affecting production data\n"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### CTAS:\n",
    "1. **Single Operation**: Creates table and loads data in one statement\n",
    "2. **Performance**: Faster than CREATE + INSERT for bulk operations\n",
    "3. **Physical Storage**: Creates actual table with stored data\n",
    "4. **Static Data**: Data is a snapshot at creation time\n",
    "5. **Use for**: Pre-aggregation, denormalization, data marts, snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporary Tables:\n",
    "1. **Session-scoped**: Exists only for current session\n",
    "2. **Automatic Cleanup**: Dropped when session ends\n",
    "3. **Isolation**: Each session has its own temporary tables\n",
    "4. **Performance**: Often faster due to temp storage location\n",
    "5. **Use for**: ETL pipelines, intermediate results, testing, complex calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use What:\n",
    "- **CTAS (Permanent Table)**: When you need persistent, fast-access data\n",
    "- **CTAS (Temporary Table)**: When you need temporary storage for session-specific processing\n",
    "- **View**: When you need real-time, always-current data\n",
    "- **CREATE + INSERT**: When you need incremental data loading\n"

    "## Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### CTAS Best Practices in Snowflake:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use ORDER BY for Clustering**: Order data by frequently queried columns\n",
    "2. **Explicit Column Types**: Define column types when needed for consistency\n",
    "3. **OR REPLACE**: Use carefully - it drops existing table\n",
    "4. **IF NOT EXISTS**: Use when you want to avoid errors if table exists\n",
    "5. **Partitioning**: Consider partitioning for very large tables\n",
    "6. **Compression**: Snowflake automatically compresses data\n",
    "7. **Monitoring**: Monitor storage costs for large CTAS operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporary Table Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., `temp_stage1_extract`)\n",
    "2. **Cleanup**: Temporary tables auto-cleanup, but you can DROP manually if needed\n",
    "3. **Session Isolation**: Remember each session has its own temporary tables\n",
    "4. **Performance**: Use for intermediate results in complex queries\n",
    "5. **Testing**: Great for testing without affecting production\n",
    "6. **Size Limits**: Be aware of temporary storage limits\n",
    "\n",
