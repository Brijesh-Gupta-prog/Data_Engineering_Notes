    "## 2. Performance Tips for Fetching Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use SELECT Specific Columns\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM large_table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT id, name, email FROM large_table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Fetching only needed columns reduces:\n",
    "- Network transfer time\n",
    "- Memory usage\n",
    "- I/O operations\n",
    "- Processing overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limit Result Sets\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 100;\n",
    "-- or\n",
    "SELECT TOP 100 * FROM orders;  -- SQL Server\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders FETCH FIRST 100 ROWS ONLY;  -- DB2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Limiting results prevents fetching unnecessary data, especially useful for:\n",
    "- Pagination\n",
    "- Preview queries\n",
    "- Testing queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use DISTINCT Sparingly\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT * FROM large_table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Only use DISTINCT when necessary\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM orders;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Or better, use GROUP BY if aggregating\n",
    "SELECT customer_id FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** DISTINCT requires sorting/grouping entire result set, which is expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid SELECT in Loops\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- In application code\n",
    "FOR each customer:\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = customer.id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Fetch all at once\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 3, ...);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Batch operations are much more efficient than multiple round trips\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Appropriate Data Types\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    id VARCHAR(255),  -- Should be INT\n",
    "    age TEXT,         -- Should be INT\n",
    "    created_at TEXT   -- Should be TIMESTAMP\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    age INT,\n",
    "    created_at TIMESTAMP\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Proper data types:\n",
    "- Use less storage\n",
    "- Enable better indexing\n",
    "- Allow faster comparisons and sorting\n"

    "## 3. Performance Tips for Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Indexed Columns in WHERE Clauses\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2024-01-01';\n",
    "-- If order_date is not indexed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create index first\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON orders(order_date);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Then query\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2024-01-01';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Indexes allow database to quickly locate rows without full table scans\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE UPPER(name) = 'JOHN';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders \n",
    "WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date < '2025-01-01';\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'JOHN';  -- Store in consistent case\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Functions on indexed columns prevent index usage, forcing full table scans\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Appropriate Comparison Operators\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE price != 100;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status <> 'cancelled';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- If most rows match, use positive conditions\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = 100;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'active';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** \n",
    "- Positive conditions can use indexes better\n",
    "- Query optimizer can make better decisions\n",
    "- Consider selectivity: if most rows match, use the opposite condition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter Early with WHERE Before JOIN\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT o.*, c.name \n",
    "FROM orders o\n",
    "JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id\n",
    "WHERE o.order_date > '2024-01-01';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Filter orders first (if possible in your DBMS)\n",
    "SELECT o.*, c.name \n",
    "FROM (SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01') o\n",
    "JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Reducing rows before joining decreases join complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use IN Instead of Multiple ORs (When Appropriate)\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders \n",
    "WHERE status = 'pending' OR status = 'processing' OR status = 'shipped';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders \n",
    "WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** IN is often optimized better by query planners\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid LIKE with Leading Wildcards\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%shirt%';\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%shirt';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- If possible, use prefix search\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE 'shirt%';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Or use full-text search for better performance\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE MATCH(name) AGAINST('shirt' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Leading wildcards prevent index usage; prefix searches can use indexes\n"

    "## 4. Performance Tips for Joining\n",
    "\n",
    "### Join Order Matters\n",
    "**Strategy:** Join smaller tables first, or let optimizer decide\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Join smaller filtered tables first\n",
    "SELECT o.*, c.name, p.name\n",
    "FROM (SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01') o\n",
    "JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id\n",
    "JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Smaller intermediate result sets reduce join complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Appropriate Join Types\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Using LEFT JOIN when INNER JOIN is sufficient\n",
    "SELECT o.*, c.name\n",
    "FROM orders o\n",
    "LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id\n",
    "WHERE c.id IS NOT NULL;  -- Effectively an INNER JOIN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT o.*, c.name\n",
    "FROM orders o\n",
    "INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** \n",
    "- INNER JOIN is typically faster than LEFT JOIN\n",
    "- Query optimizer can optimize INNER JOINs better\n",
    "- Only use LEFT/RIGHT JOIN when you need unmatched rows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index Join Columns\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Joining without indexes\n",
    "SELECT o.*, c.name\n",
    "FROM orders o\n",
    "JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;\n",
    "-- If customer_id or c.id are not indexed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create indexes on join columns\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_customers_id ON customers(id);  -- Usually primary key\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT o.*, c.name\n",
    "FROM orders o\n",
    "JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Indexes enable efficient join algorithms (hash joins, merge joins)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid Cartesian Products\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders, customers;  -- Missing WHERE clause\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders o\n",
    "JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Cartesian products create massive result sets (n × m rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use EXISTS Instead of JOIN for Existence Checks\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT c.*\n",
    "FROM customers c\n",
    "JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Good:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT c.*\n",
    "FROM customers c\n",
    "WHERE EXISTS (\n",
    "    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.id\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** EXISTS stops at first match, more efficient for existence checks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter Before Joining Large Tables\n",
    "**❌ Bad:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT o.*, c.*\n",
    "FROM large_orders_table o\n",

    "GROUP BY customer_id\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** \n",
    "- WHERE filters rows before grouping (faster)\n",
    "- HAVING filters groups after aggregation (slower)\n",
    "- Use WHERE for row-level filters, HAVING for group-level filters\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Aggregate Smartly**: Filter with WHERE before GROUP BY, index GROUP BY columns\n",
    "5. **Optimize Subqueries**: Prefer JOINs over correlated subqueries, use EXISTS for large lists\n",
    "6. **Design Tables Well**: Choose right data types, use constraints, normalize appropriately\n",
    "7. **Index Strategically**: Index frequently filtered/joined columns, avoid over-indexing, use covering indexes\n",
