    "## 6. Join Algorithms: Nested Loop Join\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nested Loop Join** is one of the three main join algorithms used by database optimizers. It works by iterating through each row in the outer table and searching for matching rows in the inner table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Nested Loop Join Works:\n",
    "1. For each row in the **outer table** (left table)\n",
    "2. Search for matching rows in the **inner table** (right table)\n",
    "3. Return matching rows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Best for**: Small tables, or when one table is much smaller than the other\n",
    "- **Cost**: O(n × m) where n = outer table rows, m = inner table rows\n",
    "- **Requires**: Index on join column of inner table for efficiency\n",
    "- **Memory**: Low memory usage\n",
    "- **When Used**: \n",
    "  - Small result sets\n",
    "  - One table is small\n",
    "  - Index exists on inner table's join column\n",
    "  - Top N queries with joins\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Join Algorithms:\n",
    "- **Hash Join**: Builds hash table from smaller table, probes with larger table\n",
    "- **Merge Join**: Sorts both tables and merges them (requires sorted inputs)\n"

    "## Performance Optimization Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monitor Execution Plans**\n",
    "   - Regularly review execution plans for expensive operations\n",
    "   - Look for table scans, missing indexes, and inefficient joins\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Index Strategy**\n",
    "   - Create indexes on frequently queried columns\n",
    "   - Use covering indexes to avoid key lookups\n",
    "   - Monitor index usage and remove unused indexes\n",
    "   - Keep statistics updated\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Optimization**\n",
    "   - Use WHERE clauses to filter early\n",
    "   - Avoid SELECT * when possible\n",
    "   - Use appropriate join types\n",
    "   - Consider query hints only when necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Partitioning Strategy**\n",
    "   - Partition large tables by date or other frequently filtered columns\n",
    "   - Ensure partition elimination in queries\n",
    "   - Align indexes with partition scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Materialized Views**\n",
    "   - Use for expensive, frequently-run queries\n",
    "   - Balance refresh frequency with data freshness requirements\n",
    "   - Monitor storage costs\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Server Specific:\n",
    "- Keep statistics updated: `UPDATE STATISTICS`\n",
    "- Rebuild/reorganize indexes regularly\n",
    "- Use appropriate fill factor for indexes\n",
    "- Monitor fragmentation levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snowflake Specific:\n",
    "- Use clustering keys for large tables\n",
    "- Enable automatic clustering for frequently queried tables\n",
    "- Use Search Optimization Service for point lookups\n",
    "- Monitor query profiles and partition pruning\n",
    "- Consider materialized views for complex aggregations\n"
