    "\n",
    "### Common Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You're working with a Spark DataFrame and you need to use it multiple times:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read data\n",
    "df = spark.read.parquet(\"large_dataset.parquet\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# First use: Calculate total sales\n",
    "total_sales = df.agg({\"sales\": \"sum\"}).collect()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second use: Calculate average sales\n",
    "avg_sales = df.agg({\"sales\": \"avg\"}).collect()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Third use: Count records\n",
    "record_count = df.count()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important: Understanding Spark's Lazy Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Misconception:**\n",
    "> \"When I do `df = spark.read.parquet(...)`, Spark reads the data and stores it in memory, so subsequent actions just use that stored data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reality:**\n",
    "> **Spark uses lazy evaluation!** The `spark.read.parquet()` call **does NOT read any data**. It only creates a **plan** for how to read the data when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Actually Happens:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Step 1: This does NOT read data - just creates a plan\n",
    "df = spark.read.parquet(\"large_dataset.parquet\")\n",
    "# df is just a \"recipe\" - no data has been read yet!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: First action triggers execution\n",
    "total_sales = df.agg({\"sales\": \"sum\"}).collect()\n",
    "# NOW Spark reads from disk → computes sum → returns result\n",
    "# But the data is NOT stored anywhere!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Second action triggers execution AGAIN\n",
    "avg_sales = df.agg({\"sales\": \"avg\"}).collect()\n",
    "# Spark reads from disk AGAIN → computes avg → returns result\n",
    "# The previous read is gone - no data was stored!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Third action triggers execution AGAIN\n",
    "record_count = df.count()\n",
    "# Spark reads from disk AGAIN → counts → returns result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = spark.read.parquet(...)\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "  [Just a plan - no data read]\n",
    "\n",
    "Action 1: df.agg({\"sales\": \"sum\"}).collect()\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "  Read from disk → Compute sum → Return result\n",
    "  [Data is NOT stored - it's discarded after use]\n",
    "\n",
    "Action 2: df.agg({\"sales\": \"avg\"}).collect()\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "  Read from disk AGAIN → Compute avg → Return result\n",
    "  [Previous read is gone - must read again!]\n",
    "\n",
    "Action 3: df.count()\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "  Read from disk AGAIN → Count → Return result\n",
    "  [Must read a third time!]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Happens:**\n",
    "- Spark doesn't store intermediate results by default\n",
    "- Each action executes the **entire plan from scratch**\n",
    "- Without caching, there's no memory of previous computations\n",
    "- The DataFrame `df` is just a plan, not stored data\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens?**\n",
    "- Each action (sum, avg, count) triggers a **full recomputation**\n",
    "- Spark reads the data from disk **three times** (once per action)\n",
    "- This is slow and wasteful!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "**With caching:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read and cache data\n",
    "df = spark.read.parquet(\"large_dataset.parquet\").cache()\n",
    "\n",
    "# First use: Reads from disk, stores in memory\n",
    "total_sales = df.agg({\"sales\": \"sum\"}).collect()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second use: Reads from memory (fast!)\n",
    "avg_sales = df.agg({\"sales\": \"avg\"}).collect()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Third use: Reads from memory (fast!)\n",
    "record_count = df.count()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Data is read from disk **only once**\n",
    "- Subsequent operations read from **memory** (much faster!)\n",
    "- Significant performance improvement for iterative algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Caching stores intermediate results in memory (or disk) so they don't need to be recomputed. This is essential when you reuse the same DataFrame multiple times.**\n"

    "### How Spark Executes Code\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a TRANSFORMATION - nothing happens yet!\n",
    "df_filtered = df.filter(df.amount > 1000)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "1. **Transformations** (filter, select, join) are **lazy** - they build a plan\n",
    "2. **Actions** (count, collect, show) are **eager** - they trigger execution\n",
    "3. When an action is called, Spark executes the **entire plan** from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Key Point: DataFrames Don't Store Data!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Understanding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This line does NOT read or store any data!\n",
    "df = spark.read.parquet(\"data.parquet\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What `df` actually is:**\n",
    "- `df` is **NOT** a container with data in memory\n",
    "- `df` is a **plan** (or \"recipe\") for how to read and process data\n",
    "- No data is read until an **action** is called\n",
    "- After an action completes, the data is **discarded** (not stored)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like this:**\n",
    "- **Traditional approach (Pandas):** `df = pd.read_csv()` → Data is loaded into memory and stored\n",
    "- **Spark approach:** `df = spark.read.parquet()` → Only a plan is created, no data loaded\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is why each action reads from disk again:**\n",
    "- Action 1: Executes plan → Reads disk → Computes → Returns result → **Data discarded**\n",
    "- Action 2: Executes plan → Reads disk → Computes → Returns result → **Data discarded**\n",
    "- Action 3: Executes plan → Reads disk → Computes → Returns result → **Data discarded**\n",

    "**Default behavior:**\n",
    "- Stores data in **memory** if possible\n",
    "- If memory is full, **spills to disk**\n",
    "- This is the safest default for most use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Persist: The Flexible Method\n",
    "\n",
    "**`persist()`** allows you to specify **exactly how** data should be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyspark import StorageLevel\n",
    "\n",
    "# Store only in memory\n",
    "df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY)\n",
    "\n",

    "| `cache()` | ❌ Fixed (uses default) | MEMORY_AND_DISK |\n",
    "| `persist()` | ✅ Customizable | You choose the storage level |\n",

    "- You're prototyping or learning\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ DO\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cache after expensive transformations**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Cache after expensive operations\n",
    "   df = df.join(other_df).filter(...).cache()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cache when reusing data multiple times**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # If you'll use it 2+ times, cache it\n",
    "   df_cached = df.filter(...).cache()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use appropriate storage levels**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # For large data, use MEMORY_AND_DISK\n",
    "   df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unpersist when done**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Free memory when you're done\n",
    "   df.unpersist()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cache before iterative operations**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Machine learning, loops, etc.\n",
    "   training_data = df.cache()\n",
    "   for epoch in range(10):\n",
    "       model.train(training_data)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Check cache status**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Verify caching worked\n",
    "   if df.is_cached:\n",
    "       print(\"Data is cached!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ DON'T\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don't cache data used only once**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # ❌ BAD: Unnecessary cache\n",
    "   df = spark.read.parquet(\"data.parquet\").cache()\n",
    "   result = df.count()  # Used only once!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Don't cache data too large for memory**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # ❌ BAD: Will cause memory issues\n",
    "   huge_df = spark.read.parquet(\"1TB_data.parquet\").cache()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Don't forget to unpersist**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # ❌ BAD: Memory leak\n",
    "   df = df.cache()\n",
    "   # ... use df ...\n",
    "   # Forgot to unpersist - memory not freed!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Don't cache streaming data**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # ❌ BAD: Streaming can't be cached effectively\n",
    "   stream_df = spark.readStream.parquet(\"path/\").cache()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Don't cache unnecessarily**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # ❌ BAD: Simple operations don't need caching\n",
    "   df = spark.read.parquet(\"data.parquet\").select(\"col1\").cache()\n",
    "   result = df.count()  # Simple operation, cache not needed\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Don't cache after every transformation**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # ❌ BAD: Too many caches\n",
    "   df1 = df.filter(...).cache()\n",
    "   df2 = df1.select(...).cache()\n",
    "   df3 = df2.groupBy(...).cache()\n",
    "   # Only cache when you'll reuse multiple times!\n",

    "**Caching:**\n",
    "- ✅ Stores intermediate results in memory/disk\n",
    "- ✅ Prevents recomputation of expensive operations\n",
    "- ✅ Essential for iterative algorithms\n",
    "- ✅ Speeds up multiple actions on same DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to cache:**\n",
    "- Data used multiple times\n",
    "- After expensive transformations\n",
    "- Before iterative operations (ML, loops)\n",
    "- When memory allows\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Golden Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cache after expensive operations, not before**\n",
    "2. **Cache when you'll reuse data 2+ times**\n",
    "3. **Always unpersist when done**\n",
    "4. **Use appropriate storage levels**\n",
    "5. **Remember: cache() is lazy - first action triggers it**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **cache() = persist() with default storage level**\n",
    "2. **persist() = customizable storage level**\n",

    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What caching and persist are**\n",
    "   - Methods to store intermediate results\n",
    "   - Prevent recomputation of expensive operations\n",
    "   - Essential for performance optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The difference between cache() and persist()**\n",
    "   - `cache()`: Convenience method with default storage level\n",
    "   - `persist()`: Flexible method with customizable storage levels\n",
    "   - Both achieve the same goal with different flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Storage levels available**\n",
    "   - MEMORY_ONLY: Fastest, but risky\n",
    "   - MEMORY_AND_DISK: Default, safest\n",
    "   - DISK_ONLY: Slowest, but reliable\n",
    "   - Serialized versions for memory efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **When to cache**\n",
    "   - Multiple actions on same DataFrame\n",
    "   - Iterative algorithms (ML)\n",
    "   - After expensive transformations\n",
    "   - When memory allows\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Best practices**\n",
    "   - Cache after expensive operations\n",
    "   - Always unpersist when done\n",
    "   - Use appropriate storage levels\n",
    "   - Check cache status\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Caching is a powerful optimization technique that stores intermediate results to avoid recomputation. Use it when you'll reuse data multiple times, but remember to unpersist when done to free memory. Cache after expensive operations, not before, and choose the right storage level for your use case.**\n",
