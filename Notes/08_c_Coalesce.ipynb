    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**`coalesce(numPartitions)`** is a Spark operation that **reduces** the number of partitions in a DataFrame or RDD **without performing a full shuffle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Only reduces partitions** - Cannot increase partition count\n",
    "2. **No full shuffle** - More efficient than repartition when reducing\n",
    "3. **Combines adjacent partitions** - Merges partitions that are already on the same executor\n",
    "4. **Minimal data movement** - Only moves data when necessary\n",

    "\n",
    "### Use Case 1: Reducing Too Many Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "- You have 1000 partitions\n",
    "- Your cluster has 16 cores\n",
    "- You want to reduce to 32 partitions (2× cores)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",

    "- Avoids expensive full shuffle\n",
    "- Much faster than `repartition(32)`\n",

    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "- You read 100 GB of data → 200 partitions\n",
    "- You filter and now have only 10 GB of data\n",
    "- But you still have 200 partitions (many are now empty or tiny)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df_filtered = df.filter(df.amount > 1000)\n",
    "df_optimized = df_filtered.coalesce(32)  # ✅ Reduce partitions after filtering\n",

    "\n",

    "- After filtering, many partitions may be small or empty\n",
    "- Reducing partitions improves efficiency\n",
    "- Coalesce is perfect for this (no need to shuffle)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case 3: Before Writing to Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "- You have 500 partitions after processing\n",
    "- You want to write to storage with fewer files (e.g., 50 files)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",

    "## When NOT to Use Coalesce\n",

    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "- You have 4 partitions\n",
    "- You need 32 partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.coalesce(32)  # ❌ This won't work! Coalesce can't increase partitions\n",
    "# Result: Still 4 partitions (coalesce ignores requests to increase)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.repartition(32)  # ✅ Use repartition to increase\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "- Coalesce can only reduce partitions\n",
    "- If you request more partitions than you have, coalesce does nothing\n",
    "- Use repartition when you need to increase\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Don't Use Coalesce When You Need Even Data Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "- You have 100 partitions with uneven data distribution (skewed)\n",
    "- You want 32 evenly distributed partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coalesce:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.coalesce(32)  # ⚠️ May preserve skew\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repartition:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.repartition(32)  # ✅ Redistributes evenly (full shuffle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "- Coalesce combines partitions locally, which may preserve existing skew\n",
    "- Repartition performs a full shuffle, which redistributes data evenly\n",
    "- If data skew is a concern, repartition is better\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Coalesce Limitation: May Not Achieve Exact Count\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**\n",
    "- Coalesce tries to reduce to the specified number\n",
    "- But it may not always achieve exactly that number if partitions are distributed across many executors\n",
    "- It's a \"best effort\" operation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.coalesce(32)  # Request 32 partitions\n",
    "actual_partitions = df.rdd.getNumPartitions()  # Might be 30, 31, 32, or 33\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ DO\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use coalesce when reducing partitions**\n",
    "   - It's faster and more efficient than repartition\n",
    "   - Avoids expensive full shuffle\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coalesce before writing to storage**\n",
    "   - Reduces number of output files\n",
    "   - More efficient for cloud storage (fewer API calls)\n",
    "   - Better for downstream consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coalesce after filtering**\n",
    "   - Many partitions may become small after filtering\n",
    "   - Reducing partitions improves efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check partition count after coalesce**\n",
    "   - Coalesce may not achieve exact count\n",
    "   - Always verify: `df.rdd.getNumPartitions()`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use coalesce after wide transformations**\n",
    "   - Joins and groupBy often create many partitions\n",
    "   - Coalesce can optimize for subsequent operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ DON'T\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don't use coalesce to increase partitions**\n",
    "   - It won't work - use repartition instead\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Don't use coalesce when you need even distribution**\n",
    "   - If data is skewed, repartition is better\n",
    "   - Coalesce may preserve existing skew\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Don't coalesce too aggressively**\n",
    "   - Don't reduce to fewer partitions than cores\n",
    "   - Maintain at least `cores` partitions (ideally 2-4×)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Don't assume coalesce achieves exact count**\n",
    "   - Always verify the actual partition count\n",
    "   - Coalesce is \"best effort\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Don't coalesce unnecessarily**\n",
    "   - If partition count is already optimal, don't coalesce\n",
    "   - Measure first, optimize second\n"

    "## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n",

    "### Mistake 1: Using Coalesce to Increase Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",

    "df = df.coalesce(32)  # ❌ If df has 4 partitions, this does nothing!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct:**\n",

    "df = df.repartition(32)  # ✅ Use repartition to increase\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Mistake 2: Not Checking Actual Partition Count\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.coalesce(32)\n",
    "# Assume it has 32 partitions (might not!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.coalesce(32)\n",
    "actual = df.rdd.getNumPartitions()  # ✅ Always verify\n",
    "print(f\"Actual partitions: {actual}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Using Coalesce on Skewed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Data is skewed, but using coalesce preserves skew\n",
    "df = df.coalesce(32)  # ⚠️ May not help with skew\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct:**\n",

    "# Use repartition to redistribute evenly\n",
    "df = df.repartition(32)  # ✅ Full shuffle redistributes evenly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 4: Coalescing Below Core Count\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cores = spark.sparkContext.defaultParallelism  # 16 cores\n",
    "df = df.coalesce(8)  # ❌ Only 8 partitions for 16 cores = waste!\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coalesce:**\n",
    "- ✅ Reduces partitions efficiently\n",
    "- ✅ Minimal data movement (local combination)\n",
    "- ✅ Faster than repartition when reducing\n",
    "- ❌ Cannot increase partitions\n",
    "- ⚠️ May preserve data skew\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repartition:**\n",
    "- ✅ Can increase or decrease partitions\n",
    "- ✅ Full shuffle (redistributes evenly)\n",
    "- ✅ Better for handling data skew\n",
    "- ❌ More expensive (full shuffle always)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Golden Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "> **When reducing partitions, use `coalesce()`. When increasing partitions or needing even distribution, use `repartition()`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coalesce = Combine locally, minimal shuffle**\n",
    "2. **Repartition = Full shuffle, redistributes all data**\n",
    "3. **Always verify partition count after coalesce**\n",
    "4. **Coalesce is faster when reducing, but repartition is more predictable**\n",
    "5. **Use coalesce before writing to reduce output files**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice using coalesce in your own Spark jobs\n",
    "- Monitor Spark UI to see the difference in data movement\n",
    "- Experiment with coalesce vs repartition on your data\n",
    "- Review `08_b_Partitions_Concepts.ipynb` to understand partition optimization\n"

    "   - Operation to reduce partitions without full shuffle\n",
    "   - Combines partitions locally when possible\n",
    "   - More efficient than repartition when reducing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When to use coalesce**\n",
    "   - Reducing too many partitions\n",
    "   - After filtering large datasets\n",
    "   - Before writing to storage\n",
    "   - After wide transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How coalesce differs from repartition**\n",
    "   - Coalesce: Minimal shuffle, local combination\n",
    "   - Repartition: Full shuffle, redistributes all data\n",
    "   - Coalesce: Can only reduce\n",
    "   - Repartition: Can increase or decrease\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Best practices**\n",
    "   - Use coalesce when reducing partitions\n",
    "   - Use repartition when increasing or needing even distribution\n",
    "   - Always verify partition count\n",
    "   - Don't coalesce below core count\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Coalesce is your go-to tool for efficiently reducing partitions. It's faster than repartition because it avoids the expensive full shuffle. But remember: it can only reduce, not increase, and may preserve data skew.**\n",
