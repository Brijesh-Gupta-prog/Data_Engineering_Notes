    "# 2f Window Functions: The Power of Row-Level Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window functions are one of the most powerful yet misunderstood features in SQL.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regular aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) that collapse rows into a single result, **window functions perform calculations across a set of rows while keeping all individual rows visible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Difference:**\n",
    "- **Regular Aggregation:** `SUM(sales)` → Returns ONE row with total\n",
    "- **Window Function:** `SUM(sales) OVER()` → Returns ALL rows, each with the total\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Window Functions Matter:**\n",
    "- 📊 Calculate running totals, moving averages, and rankings\n",
    "- 📈 Compare individual rows to group averages\n",
    "- 🎯 Identify top performers within each category\n",
    "- 📉 Calculate percentiles and cumulative distributions\n",
    "- 🔍 Answer \"what percentage of total does this represent?\" questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database:** This course uses **Snowflake** database. All examples are Snowflake-compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- Understanding the difference between aggregation and window functions\n",
    "- The intuitive framework to remember window function syntax\n",
    "- ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK() for rankings\n",
    "- SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() as window functions\n",
    "- PARTITION BY - grouping within window functions\n",
    "- ORDER BY - ordering within window functions\n",
    "- ROWS BETWEEN - defining window frames\n",
    "- Real-world scenarios with simple, clear examples\n",

    "## The Intuitive Framework: Remember Window Functions in 3 Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of window functions like **\"looking through a window\"** at your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FUNCTION() OVER(\n",
    "    PARTITION BY column    -- \"Which window?\" (grouping)\n",
    "    ORDER BY column        -- \"How to arrange?\" (sorting)\n",
    "    ROWS BETWEEN ...       -- \"How many rows?\" (frame)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Framework:**\n",
    "1. **FUNCTION()** - What calculation? (SUM, AVG, ROW_NUMBER, etc.)\n",
    "2. **PARTITION BY** - Which groups? (like GROUP BY, but keeps all rows)\n",
    "3. **ORDER BY** - How to sort within each partition?\n",
    "4. **ROWS BETWEEN** - Which rows to include? (optional, for running calculations)\n",

    "✅ **ROWS BETWEEN** = frame specification (which rows to include)  \n",
