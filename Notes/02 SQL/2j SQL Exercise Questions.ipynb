    "- What relationships exist between tables?\n",
    "- What is the expected output format?\n",

    "- Do I need aggregations? (GROUP BY)\n",
    "- Do I need window functions? (OVER)\n",
    "- Do I need CTEs? (WITH)\n",
    "- Do I need to handle NULLs? (COALESCE)\n",

    "### Step 3: Plan the Query Structure\n",
    "- Start with the base table(s)\n",
    "- Add JOINs in logical order\n",

    "- Apply window functions if needed\n",
    "- Order results (ORDER BY)\n",

    "- Empty result sets\n",
    "- Duplicate records\n",
    "- Data type conversions\n",

    "### Step 5: Test and Refine\n",

    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Simple:** Begin with basic SELECT, then add JOINs, then aggregations\n",
    "2. **Test Incrementally:** Build your query step by step, testing each addition\n",
    "3. **Handle NULLs Early:** Use COALESCE/NVL at the beginning of calculations\n",
    "4. **Use CTEs for Complexity:** Break complex queries into logical CTEs\n",
    "5. **Verify Join Types:** Ensure you're using the correct join type (INNER vs LEFT)\n",
    "6. **Check Aggregations:** Make sure all non-aggregated columns are in GROUP BY\n",
    "7. **Test with Sample Data:** Run queries on small subsets first\n",
    "8. **Document Your Logic:** Add comments explaining complex parts\n",
