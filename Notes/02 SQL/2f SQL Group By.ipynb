    "# SQL GROUP BY: Aggregating and Summarizing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**GROUP BY** is one of the most powerful SQL features for data analysis and reporting. It allows you to:\n",
    "- 📊 **Summarize data** by grouping rows together\n",
    "- 📈 **Calculate aggregates** like totals, averages, counts\n",
    "- 🔍 **Analyze patterns** across different categories\n",
    "- 📋 **Create reports** from detailed transaction data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world scenarios:**\n",
    "- \"What's the total revenue by product category?\"\n",
    "- \"How many orders did each customer place?\"\n",
    "- \"What's the average order value by region?\"\n",
    "- \"Which products are selling the most?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- Understanding GROUP BY fundamentals\n",
    "- Using aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)\n",
    "- GROUP BY with multiple columns\n",
    "- HAVING clause for filtering groups\n",
    "- Common patterns and best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database:** This course uses **Snowflake** database. All examples are Snowflake-compatible. Additional notes for SQL Server are provided where relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- Understanding of SELECT statements\n",
    "- Knowledge of WHERE clause\n",
    "- Basic SQL syntax\n",

    "- `customers` - Customer information\n",
    "- `orders` - Order information  \n",
    "- `products` - Product catalog\n",
    "- `order_items` - Items in each order\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Reference - Table Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**customers:**\n",
    "- customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, city, country\n",
    "\n",
    "**orders:**\n",
    "- order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount, status\n",
    "\n",
    "**products:**\n",
    "- product_id, product_name, category, price, stock_quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "**order_items:**\n",

    "## Understanding GROUP BY: The Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is GROUP BY?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GROUP BY** groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It's like creating subtotals in a spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it as:** \"Show me one row for each unique combination of these columns, with aggregated values.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before GROUP BY (Raw Data):**\n",
    "| order_id | customer_id | total_amount |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "| 1001 | 1 | 1029.98 |\n",
    "| 1002 | 2 | 379.98 |\n",
    "| 1003 | 1 | 149.99 |\n",
    "| 1004 | 3 | 1299.97 |\n",
    "| 1005 | 4 | 89.99 |\n",
    "| 1006 | 2 | 199.99 |\n",
    "| 1007 | 5 | 429.98 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**After GROUP BY customer_id:**\n",

    "| 4 | 1 | 89.99 |\n",
    "| 5 | 1 | 429.98 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happened:**\n",
    "- Rows with the same `customer_id` were grouped together\n",
    "- We calculated aggregates: count of orders and sum of amounts\n",
    "- Multiple rows became one summary row per customer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **All non-aggregated columns** in SELECT must be in GROUP BY\n",
    "2. **Aggregate functions** (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) can be used without GROUP BY\n",
    "3. **WHERE filters rows** before grouping\n",
    "4. **HAVING filters groups** after grouping\n",

    "\n",
    "## Aggregate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into GROUP BY, let's understand the aggregate functions we'll use:\n",
    "\n",
    "### COUNT: Counting Rows\n",
    "\n",
    "**COUNT(*)** - Counts all rows (including NULLs)  \n",
    "**COUNT(column)** - Counts non-NULL values in a column  \n",
    "**COUNT(DISTINCT column)** - Counts unique non-NULL values\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUM: Adding Values\n",
    "\n",
    "**SUM(column)** - Sums all values in a column (ignores NULLs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### AVG: Calculating Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "**AVG(column)** - Calculates average (ignores NULLs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### MIN and MAX: Finding Extremes\n",
    "\n",
    "**MIN(column)** - Finds minimum value (ignores NULLs)  \n",
    "**MAX(column)** - Finds maximum value (ignores NULLs)\n",

    "### Mistake 2: Using WHERE Instead of HAVING\n",

    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "```\n",

    "### Mistake 3: Not Handling NULLs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** NULL values create separate groups, which may not be desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use COALESCE before grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 4: Incorrect COUNT Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Confusion:**\n",
    "- `COUNT(*)` - Counts all rows (including NULLs)\n",
    "- `COUNT(column)` - Counts non-NULL values only\n",

    "1. **Include all non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY**\n",
    "2. **Use WHERE for row filtering, HAVING for group filtering**\n",
    "3. **Handle NULLs with COALESCE before grouping**\n",
    "4. **Use COUNT(DISTINCT) when you need unique counts**\n",
    "5. **Use meaningful column aliases for aggregates**\n",

    "\n",
    "### ❌ DON'Ts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don't forget columns in GROUP BY**\n",
    "2. **Don't use aggregate functions in WHERE clause**\n",
    "3. **Don't ignore NULL handling**\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GROUP BY groups rows** with the same values into summary rows\n",
    "2. **Aggregate functions** (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) calculate values for each group\n",
    "3. **All non-aggregated columns** must be in GROUP BY clause\n",
    "4. **WHERE filters rows** before grouping, **HAVING filters groups** after grouping\n",
    "5. **NULL values** create separate groups - handle them with COALESCE\n",
    "6. **COUNT DISTINCT** counts unique values, COUNT counts all rows\n",
    "7. **LEFT JOIN** preserves all records from the left table in grouped results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Use Cases:**\n",
    "- ✅ Summarizing sales by category, region, or time period\n",
    "- ✅ Calculating customer lifetime value\n",
    "- ✅ Analyzing product performance\n",
    "- ✅ Creating reports and dashboards\n",
    "- ✅ Finding top/bottom performers\n",
