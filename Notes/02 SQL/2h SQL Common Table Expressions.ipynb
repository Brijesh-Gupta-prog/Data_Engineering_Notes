    "# SQL Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Simplifying Complex Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** are a powerful SQL feature that allows you to create temporary, named result sets that exist only for the duration of a single query. Think of CTEs as **\"temporary views\"** that make complex queries more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why CTEs Matter:**\n",
    "- 📖 **Readability** - Break complex queries into logical, named parts\n",
    "- 🔄 **Reusability** - Reference the same subquery multiple times\n",
    "- 🧹 **Maintainability** - Easier to debug and modify complex logic\n",
    "- 🎯 **Recursive Queries** - Enable recursive operations (hierarchies, trees)\n",
    "- 🔍 **Duplicate Detection** - Essential for finding and removing duplicate records\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database:** This course uses **Snowflake** database. All examples are Snowflake-compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- Understanding what CTEs are and when to use them\n",
    "- Basic CTE syntax and structure\n",
    "- Multiple CTEs in a single query\n",
    "- Using CTEs to find duplicates\n",
    "- Using CTEs to delete duplicates\n",
    "- Recursive CTEs (brief introduction)\n",
    "- Real-world scenarios with practical examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- Understanding of SELECT statements\n",
    "- Knowledge of JOINs and subqueries\n",
    "- Basic SQL aggregation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Common Table Expression (CTE)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **CTE** is a temporary named result set that exists only within the scope of a single SQL statement. It's defined using the `WITH` clause and can be referenced multiple times in the main query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a CTE like a **\"helper table\"** that you create on-the-fly:\n",
    "- You define it once with `WITH`\n",
    "- You can use it multiple times in your query\n",
    "- It disappears after the query completes\n",
    "- It makes your query easier to read and understand\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH cte_name AS (\n",
    "    SELECT ...\n",
    "    FROM ...\n",
    "    WHERE ...\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT ...\n",
    "FROM cte_name\n",
    "WHERE ...;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- CTE starts with `WITH`\n",
    "- CTE name follows `AS`\n",
    "- CTE definition is in parentheses\n",
    "- Main query references the CTE by name\n",
    "- CTE only exists for that one query\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use CTEs Instead of Subqueries?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Without CTE (Using Subquery)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    customer_id,\n",
    "    total_orders,\n",
    "    total_spent\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "    SELECT \n",
    "        c.customer_id,\n",
    "        COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,\n",
    "        SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent\n",
    "    FROM customers c\n",
    "    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n",
    "    GROUP BY c.customer_id\n",
    ") AS customer_summary\n",
    "WHERE total_spent > 500\n",
    "ORDER BY total_spent DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:**\n",
    "- Hard to read (nested subquery)\n",
    "- Can't reuse the subquery\n",
    "- Difficult to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: With CTE (Much Cleaner!)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH customer_summary AS (\n",
    "    SELECT \n",
    "        c.customer_id,\n",
    "        COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,\n",
    "        SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent\n",
    "    FROM customers c\n",
    "    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n",
    "    GROUP BY c.customer_id\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    customer_id,\n",
    "    total_orders,\n",
    "    total_spent\n",
    "FROM customer_summary\n",
    "WHERE total_spent > 500\n",
    "ORDER BY total_spent DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- ✅ Much more readable\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to understand the logic\n",
    "- ✅ Can reference `customer_summary` multiple times\n",
    "- ✅ Easier to debug and modify\n",

    "## Part 5: Best Practices and Common Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Using CTEs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always Test DELETE Queries First**\n",
    "   - Use SELECT to preview what will be deleted\n",
    "   - Verify the logic before executing DELETE\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Meaningful CTE Names**\n",
    "   - `customer_summary` is better than `cte1`\n",
    "   - Makes queries self-documenting\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Keep CTEs Focused**\n",
    "   - Each CTE should have a single, clear purpose\n",
    "   - Don't make CTEs too complex\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Order Matters**\n",
    "   - CTEs are evaluated in order\n",
    "   - Later CTEs can reference earlier CTEs\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance Considerations**\n",
    "   - CTEs are evaluated each time they're referenced\n",
    "   - For very large datasets, consider materialized views or temp tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common CTE Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pattern 1: Finding Duplicates\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH duplicates AS (\n",
    "    SELECT column, COUNT(*) AS cnt\n",
    "    FROM table\n",
    "    GROUP BY column\n",
    "    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT * FROM table\n",
    "WHERE column IN (SELECT column FROM duplicates);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pattern 2: Ranking and Filtering\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH ranked AS (\n",
    "    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY key ORDER BY id) AS rn\n",
    "    FROM table\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE rn = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pattern 3: Multi-Step Calculations\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH step1 AS (SELECT ...),\n",
    "     step2 AS (SELECT ... FROM step1),\n",
    "     step3 AS (SELECT ... FROM step2)\n",
    "SELECT * FROM step3;\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Summary: Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **CTEs make complex queries readable** - Break down complex logic into named parts  \n",
    "✅ **CTEs enable reusability** - Reference the same subquery multiple times  \n",
    "✅ **CTEs are perfect for duplicates** - Essential tool for finding and deleting duplicates  \n",
    "✅ **Always test DELETE queries** - Use SELECT first to preview what will be deleted  \n",
    "✅ **Use ROW_NUMBER() for duplicate handling** - Assign ranks to identify which records to keep  \n",
    "✅ **Multiple CTEs can chain together** - Each CTE can reference previous CTEs  \n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use CTEs:**\n",
    "- 📊 Complex queries with multiple steps\n",
    "- 🔍 Finding and removing duplicates\n",
    "- 📈 Multi-level aggregations\n",
    "- 🔄 Queries that need to reference the same subquery multiple times\n",
    "- 🧹 Data cleaning and transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "**CTE vs Subquery:**\n",
    "- **CTE:** More readable, can be referenced multiple times, easier to debug\n",
    "- **Subquery:** More compact for simple cases, but harder to read when nested\n",

    "## Practice Exercises\n",

    "Try these exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find duplicate products** by name and category\n",
    "2. **Delete duplicate order items**, keeping the one with the highest quantity\n",
    "3. **Create a customer report** showing total orders, total spent, and average order value using CTEs\n",
    "4. **Find customers** who have duplicate orders on the same day\n",
    "5. **Create a summary** of all duplicate records across all tables\n",
