        "**General Guidelines:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Power of 2** (recommended)\n",
        "   - 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024\n",
        "   - Easier for Spark to optimize\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Based on data size**\n",
        "   - Small data (< 1 GB): 16-32 buckets\n",
        "   - Medium data (1-100 GB): 32-128 buckets\n",
        "   - Large data (> 100 GB): 128-512 buckets\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Based on cluster size**\n",
        "   - Should be multiple of number of cores\n",
        "   - Example: 16 cores → 32, 64, or 128 buckets\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Avoid too many buckets**\n",
        "   - Too many small files (overhead)\n",
        "   - Generally avoid > 1000 buckets\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Choices\n",

        "| Data Size | Recommended Buckets | Reason |\n",
        "|-----------|-------------------|--------|\n",

        "- ✅ Pre-organizes data for efficient joins\n",
        "- ✅ Avoids expensive shuffles during joins\n",
        "- ✅ Requires same bucket count and column for joined tables\n",
        "\n",
        "**Partitioning:**\n",
        "- ✅ Divides data by actual column values\n",
        "- ✅ Creates separate directories\n",
        "- ✅ Used for filtering and data pruning\n",
        "- ✅ Variable number of partitions\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **What bucketing is**\n",
        "   - Divides data into fixed number of buckets based on hash\n",
        "   - Pre-organizes data for efficient joins\n",
        "   - Different from partitioning (which uses actual values)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why bucketing matters**\n",
        "   - Optimizes joins by avoiding shuffles\n",
        "   - Pre-organizes data so matching rows are co-located\n",
        "   - Significantly improves join performance\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **How to create bucketed tables**\n",
        "   - Use `bucketBy(num_buckets, \"column\")`\n",
        "   - Must use `saveAsTable()` to preserve metadata\n",
        "   - Can combine with `sortBy()` for additional optimization\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Requirements for bucket joins**\n",
        "   - Same number of buckets in both tables\n",
        "   - Same bucketing column(s)\n",
        "   - Join on bucketing column(s)\n",
        "   - Tables saved as Hive tables\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **When to use bucketing**\n",
        "   - Frequent joins on same key\n",

        "6. **Best practices**\n",
        "   - Use powers of 2 for bucket count\n",
        "   - Choose bucket count based on data size\n",
        "   - Bucket by join keys\n",
        "   - Ensure both tables have same bucket configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Bottom Line\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Bucketing is a powerful optimization technique that pre-organizes data for efficient joins. By ensuring rows with the same join key values are in the same bucket, Spark can join corresponding buckets without expensive shuffles. Use bucketing when you frequently join large tables on the same key, but remember that both tables must have the same bucket count and bucketing column for it to work.**\n",
