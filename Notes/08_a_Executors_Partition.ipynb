    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The difference** between file partitions in storage (ADLS) and partitions in Spark executors\n",
    "2. **Why idle partitions occur** and how they waste resources\n",

    "## Step 1: Understanding Your Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into partitions, let's understand the setup we're working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Your Spark cluster setup\n",
    "num_executors = 4\n",
    "cores_per_executor = 4\n",
    "total_cores = num_executors * cores_per_executor  # 16 cores total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means:**\n",
    "- You have **4 executors** (JVM processes running on worker nodes)\n",
    "- Each executor has **4 CPU cores** available\n",
    "- Total available parallelism: **16 cores**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Misconception:**\n",
    "> \"I have 16 cores, so I have 16-way parallelism\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reality:** This is only true if you have **at least 16 partitions**. Having 16 cores doesn't automatically give you 16-way parallelism - you need 16 tasks (one per partition) to utilize all cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Storage Configuration (ADLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Your data layout in ADLS\n",
    "data_path = \"abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/sales/\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Files in the sales directory:\n",

    "#   └── part-00003.parquet (256 GB)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means:**\n",
    "- You have **4 large Parquet files** in your storage\n",
    "- Each file is **256 GB** (1 TB total)\n",
    "- These are **file partitions** - a way to organize data in storage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Distinction:**\n",
    "- **File partitions** (storage level) ≠ **Spark partitions** (compute level)\n",
    "- The number of files does NOT automatically equal the number of Spark partitions\n"

    "## Step 2: What We're Trying to Achieve\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal: Maximum Resource Utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we want:**\n",
    "- All 16 cores working simultaneously\n",
    "- No idle executors or cores\n",
    "- Efficient data processing with minimal waste\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- **Cost efficiency**: You're paying for all 16 cores - use them!\n",
    "- **Performance**: More parallelism = faster job completion\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Understanding this helps you scale properly\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Ideal Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Executor 1: [Task 1] [Task 2] [Task 3] [Task 4] → All 4 cores busy\n",
    "Executor 2: [Task 5] [Task 6] [Task 7] [Task 8] → All 4 cores busy\n",

    "## Step 8: Production-Grade Rules to Follow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 1: Files Are NOT Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical distinction:**\n",
    "- **Storage layout** (file partitions) ≠ **Compute layout** (Spark partitions)\n",
    "- Stop conflating them!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- You might have 4 files in ADLS (storage partitioning)\n",
    "- But you need 32+ Spark partitions for optimal compute\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 2: Always Check Partition Count\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before running expensive operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Always verify\n",
    "num_partitions = df.rdd.getNumPartitions()\n",
    "total_cores = spark.sparkContext.defaultParallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "if num_partitions < total_cores:\n",
    "    print(f\"⚠️  WARNING: Only {num_partitions} partitions for {total_cores} cores!\")\n",
    "    print(\"Consider repartitioning!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**If `num_partitions < total_cores`:**\n",
    "- You are wasting money and time\n",
    "- Your cluster is underutilized\n",
    "- Your job will run slower than necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 3: Broadcast Join ≠ Performance Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common mistake:**\n",
    "> \"I'll use broadcast join to fix my performance issues\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reality:**\n",
    "- Broadcast join removes shuffle (good!)\n",
    "- But if your partitions are wrong, broadcast won't save you\n",
    "- You still need proper partitioning for the large table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both matter:**\n",
    "- ✅ Broadcast small tables (avoid shuffle)\n",
    "- ✅ Properly partition large tables (utilize cores)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 4: Choose Partition Count Wisely\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines:**\n",
    "- **Minimum:** `num_partitions ≥ total_cores`\n",
    "- **Ideal:** `num_partitions = 2-4 × total_cores`\n",
    "- **Why 2-4×?**\n",
    "  - Hides I/O wait times (while one task waits for I/O, others run)\n",
    "  - Better load balancing (handles data skew)\n",
    "  - Allows for task queuing (smooth execution)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too many partitions:**\n",
    "- Overhead from task scheduling\n",
    "- Small tasks are inefficient\n",
    "- Generally avoid: `num_partitions > 10 × total_cores`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 5: Understand When Repartitioning Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "**`repartition()`:**\n",
    "- Triggers a **full shuffle**\n",
    "- Redistributes data across all partitions\n",
    "- Use when you need to change partition count significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "**`coalesce()`:**\n",
    "- Reduces partition count **without shuffle**\n",
    "- Combines adjacent partitions\n",
    "- Use when reducing partitions (more efficient than repartition)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If you have 100 partitions and want 32\n",
    "df.coalesce(32)  # More efficient (no shuffle)\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you have 4 partitions and want 32\n",
    "df.repartition(32)  # Necessary (requires shuffle)\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Storage partitions ≠ Compute partitions**\n",
    "   - Files in ADLS are storage-level organization\n",
    "   - Spark partitions are compute-level organization\n",
    "   - They can (and often should) be different!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **One partition = one task = one core**\n",
    "   - This is a fundamental Spark rule\n",
    "   - More partitions = more parallelism potential\n",
    "   - But only if you have enough cores\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Always check partition count**\n",
    "   - Use `df.rdd.getNumPartitions()`\n",
    "   - Compare with `spark.sparkContext.defaultParallelism`\n",
    "   - If partitions < cores, you're wasting resources\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimal partition count**\n",
    "   - Minimum: Equal to number of cores\n",
    "   - Ideal: 2-4× number of cores\n",
    "   - Too many: Overhead and inefficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repartition when needed**\n",
    "   - Use `repartition()` to increase partitions (triggers shuffle)\n",
    "   - Use `coalesce()` to decrease partitions (no shuffle)\n",
    "   - Always verify the result\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ❌ Assuming file count = optimal partition count\n",
    "2. ❌ Not checking partition count before expensive operations\n",
    "3. ❌ Thinking broadcast join fixes all performance issues\n",
    "4. ❌ Creating too many or too few partitions\n",
    "5. ❌ Not understanding the difference between storage and compute partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice: Try reading your own data and checking partition counts\n",
    "- Experiment: Compare performance with different partition counts\n",
    "- Monitor: Use Spark UI to visualize task distribution\n",
    "- Learn: Understand how partitioning affects joins, aggregations, and shuffles\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configuration Understanding**\n",
    "   - Cluster: 4 executors × 4 cores = 16 total cores\n",
    "   - Storage: 4 files × 256 GB = 1 TB total data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Problem**\n",
    "   - Naive read creates 4 partitions → 4 tasks\n",
    "   - Only 4 cores used → 12 cores idle (75% waste)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Solution**\n",
    "   - Repartition to 32 partitions (2× core count)\n",
    "   - Creates 32 tasks → all 16 cores utilized\n",
    "   - Better load balancing and I/O hiding\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Best Practices**\n",
    "   - Always check partition count\n",
    "   - Aim for 2-4× core count\n",
    "   - Understand storage vs compute partitions\n",
    "   - Use repartition/coalesce appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"Files are not partitions. Storage layout ≠ Compute layout. Always verify your partition count matches your cluster capacity.\"**\n",
